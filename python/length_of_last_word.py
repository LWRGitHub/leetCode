    Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

    A word is a maximal 
    substring
    consisting of non-space characters only.

    

    Example 1:
        Input: s = "Hello World"
        Output: 5
        Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.

    Example 2:
        Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
        Output: 4
        Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.

    Example 3:
        Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
        Output: 6
        Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
    

    Constraints:
        1 <= s.length <= 104
        s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
        There will be at least one word in s.
